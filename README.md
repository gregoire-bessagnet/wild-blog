# Wild Code School - Last checkpoint
A simple MEAN Stack blog used as a project for the final evaluation of JS students of [Wild Code School](http://wildcodeschool.fr).

We had to deal with multiple exercices **from debugging to write documentation, factoring or implementing new functions**.  
This Readme is a part of theses exercices.
